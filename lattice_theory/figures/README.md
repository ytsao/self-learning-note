# This file provides information about the figures used in the lecture notes, including instructions on how to add or reference figures.

# Figures should be placed in this directory. 

# To include a figure in your LaTeX document, use the following command:
# \begin{figure}[h]
#     \centering
#     \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{path/to/your/figure}
#     \caption{Your figure caption here.}
#     \label{fig:your_label}
# \end{figure}

# Make sure to replace "path/to/your/figure" with the actual path to the figure file. 
# Use appropriate labels for referencing figures in the text.
